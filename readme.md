# Horizon scanning of potential new alien vascular plant species and their distribution across the Arctic in a changing climate
This project is a part of a master thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
The project will use horizon scanning to identify potential new alien vascular plant species and their distribution across the Arctic under "current" climate conditions (1970-2000).
