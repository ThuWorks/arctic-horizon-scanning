Each polygon within this coverage has 7 attributes in common: bioclimatic subzone, floristic province, substrate chemistry, percent lake cover, landscape, and vegetation. During the production of the map, coverages were created for each separately mapped area. These were then combined for the final map into a single coverage.Mapping methods The methods, basic subdivisions of the Arctic, and people who would do the mapping were chosen at a series of international workshops (Walker and Markon 1996, Walker and Lillie 1997, Markon and Walker 2000, Gonzalez et al. 2000, Raynolds and Markon 2001). An integrated mapping procedure was used to delineate vegetation polygons for the CAVM (Walker 1999). The method is based on landscape-guided mapping developed by the International Training Centre for Aerial Survey (ITC, now called the Institute of Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences) in the Netherlands (Zonneveld 1988), and is based on the principle that soil and vegetation boundaries on maps are controlled by physiographic landscape features. The Integrated Terrain Unit Mapping (ITUM) approach is a similar method applied to geographic information system (GIS) technology (Dangermond and Harnden 1990). The geobotatical mapping procedures used in arctic Alaska at the Alaska Geobotany Center are based on the same philosophy (Walker et al. 1980), as are the procedures used in the "landschaft" approach developed by the Earth Cryosphere Institute in Moscow (Melnikov 1988, 1998). The first step in the integrated mapping procedure was to collect and evaluate all the relevant maps and literature for a region. Map sources included remote sensing imagery, topography and hydrology based on the Digital Chart of the World, vegetation maps, surficial geology, bedrock geology, soils, percentage water cover, bioclimate subzones, and floristic provinces. Hard copy maps that were deemed useful for helping to define vegetation boundaries were then photographically reproduced to 1:4 million scale. In some cases, the source maps had more detail than was useful for the vegetation map, so simplified source maps were created. These maps were then used as overlays on the 1:4 million AVHRR false-CIR image, and the boundaries were adjusted to match the image features.AVHRR false-CIR images were printed for each country. These were sent to local experts, who mapped their respective regions. Vegetation polygons boundaries were hand-drawn on an acetate overlay, combining the terrain information and following features visible on the 1:4 million AVHRR base image. These polygons were digitized and used to create ARC/INFO polygon coverages.Minimum mapping unitThe minimum polygon size for the CAVM project was defined as 3.5 mm on a side or 2 mm across for linear features, at 1:4 M scale. This scale was chosen for practicality of hand drawing and digitizing polygons at 1:4 M, and for visibility on the final 1:7.5 M printed map. This translates to 14 km (14 pixels) on a side (196 km2), and 8 km across for linear features. In areas with small-scale heterogeneity, such as areas of islands and fjords, polygons as small as 50 km2were used. Ecologically important areas such as river corridors were mapped down to 5 km in width. These small polygons are included in the final coverage, though they may not be visible on the printed map.Mapping methods referencesDangermond, J., and E. Harnden. 1990.

The CAVM divides the Arctic into five bioclimate subzones based on a combination of summer temperature and vegetation.  Subzone A is the coldest, most barren subzone, and Subzone E is the warmest and lushest.  

Comparison with other zonation approaches
Different geobotanical traditions have divided the Arctic into bioclimatic regions using a variety of terminologies (see Table 1 CAVM).  The origins of these different terms and approaches have been reviewed for the PanArctic Flora (PAF) initiative. The PAF and CAVM have accepted the five-subzone approach used here (Elvebakk et al. 1999).

Description of Arctic bioclimate subzone categories A-E
As one moves from north to south across the Arctic, the amount of warmth available for plant growth increases. The mean July temperatures are near 0˚C on the northernmost islands. At these temperatures, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Warmer summer temperatures cause the size, horizontal cover, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to increase (see Table 2 CAVM).  Woody plants and sedges are absent in Subzone A, where mean July temperatures are less than 3˚C. Woody plants first occur in Subzone B (mean July temperatures about 3-5˚ C) as prostrate (creeping) dwarf shrubs, and increase in stature to hemiprostrate dwarf shrubs (&lt;15 cm tall) in Subzone C (mean July temperatures about 5-7˚C, erect dwarf shrubs (&lt;40 cm tall) in Subzone D (mean July temperature about 7-9˚C), and low shrubs (40-200 cm tall) in Subzone E (mean July temperature about 9-12˚C. At treeline, where the mean July temperatures are between 10 and 12˚C, woody shrubs up to 2 meters tall are abundant. The number of plants in local floras available to form plant communities increases from fewer than 50 species in the coldest parts of the Arctic to as many as 500 species near treeline.

Mapping process
Initial bioclimate subzone boundaries were taken from the Panarctic Flora (PAF) initiative (Elvebakk et al. 1999, see CAVM for additional references).  The boundaries were drawn by the mappers for individual countries, and then adjusted to follow existing vegetation polygon boundaries.  The vegetation polygons are drawn at a much finer resolution than the bioclimate subzone boundaries, so little information was lost in this process.  Most areas are mapped with broad bands of bioclimate subzones, but Svalbard subzones were mapped in more detail, showing the changes that occur from the coast inland, and so that section of the map contains many small subzone polygons.  Canada - PAF boundaries adjusted by W.A. Gould to match data from Edlund (pers.comm.) and personal knowledge.  Greenland - Boundaries drawn by F.J.A. Daniëls.  Iceland - all subzone E.  Norway - Boundaries drawn by A. Elvebakk. Russia - PAF boundaries modified by B.A. Yurtsev, especially Yakutia and Chukotka.  The data from Russia included a sixth subzone (stlanik areas), and subdivided the subzones into mountainous and non-mountainous areas.  There are a number of boreal inclusion areas mapped within Chukotka.  The boundaries of these polygons are much more detailed than the generalized zonal boundaries in the rest of Russia. United States - PAF boundaries modified in details by D.A. Walker and M.K. Raynolds, mostly along southern edge of Subzone E (see tree line metadata).

The Arctic has a relatively consistent core of plant species that occur around the circumpolar region, but there is also considerable east to west variation in the regional floras, particularly in the more southern subzones (C, D, and E). This variation is due to a number of factors, including different histories related to glaciations, land bridges, and north-south trending mountain ranges, primarily in Asia. These influences have restricted the exchange of species between parts of the Arctic. Russian geobotanists have described subdivisions based primarily on these floristic differences. Floristic provinces were mapped from the Panarctic Flora Initiative (Elvebakk et al. 1999), based largely on Yurtsev (1994) (Table 9).  The boundaries were then adjusted to follow vegetation polygon boundaries.  The vegetation polygons are drawn at a much finer resolution than the floristic province boundaries, so little information was lost in this process.

 The landscape map was derived from topographic data, regional physiographic maps, and visual interpretation of the AVHRR false-CIR image.  Landscape codes were assigned to each of the vegetation polygons.  For Greenland, Russia and the United States, detailed landscape maps formed the basis of the vegetation polygons (see vegetation mapping section).  However, these regional landscape maps did not have a uniform legend and could not be easily combined.  The detailed landscape categories were combined into the ten general categories most useful in creating the vegetation map (Table 12), which were further combined into five categories for the final map (plains, hills, mountains, glaciers (including nunataks), and water (including lakes, lagoons, and ocean)).  The plateau category was merged with the either the hill category (&lt;500 m elevation) or the mountain category (&gt;500 m elevation), because it was interpreted differently in different portions of the map.  Riparian areas were also not consistently defined in different parts of the map.  Many riparian areas, though of great ecological importance, were also too narrow to map (less than 5 km width).  For these reasons, the riparian landscape category (and the riparian vegetation category) were mapped as linear features, not polygons. 

Canada and United States: Landscape codes were derived from the "integrated landscape unit map" (ILUM) code (see metadata for vegetation mapping).  

Greenland: Landscape codes were derived from the "integrated landscape unit map" (ILUM) code (see metadata for vegetation mapping).  

Iceland: The landscape categories for Iceland were interpreted by M.K. Raynolds, using the AVHRR  false-color CIR image and the elevation map.

Norway: The landscape categories were determined based on the vegetation code (see metadata for vegetation mapping).  

Russia: The Russian mappers provided "landschaft" (landscape) codes for each of their polygons.  These were based largely on an existing landscape map (Gudilin 1980).  The polygons were grouped into landscape units for the CAVM based on the description of the "landschaft" codes.  Riparian areas were not mapped separately under the Russian "landschaft" approach, so polygons with riparian vegetation codes ("veget-id") were coded as riparian landscape.  This proved to be ineffective - the definition of riparian area was too inconsistent across Russia, and between Russia and other areas of the Arctic.

Differences in substrate chemistry have important effects on dominant plant communities. Some of the most important effects are related to soil pH, which governs the availability of essential plant nutrients. Soils in the circumneutral range (pH 5.5-7.2) are generally mineral rich, whereas the full suite of essential nutrients are often unavailable in acidic soils (pH &lt; 5.5) or in soils associated with calcareous bedrock (pH &gt; 7.2). The latter often have unique assemblages of endemic plant species. There are no common base maps that show this essential difference in substrate chemistry, so the CAVM substrate map was derived from a wide variety of available sources including soil, surficial geology, and bedrock geology maps, and from spectral patterns that could be recognized on the AVHRR base image.  The pH values of the three categories were based on the field experience and hundreds of Arctic vegetation relevé plots sampled by D.A. Walker on the North Slope and Seward Peninsula of Alaska, in consultation with F.J.A. Daniëls (Greenland) and N.G. Moskalenko (Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas, Russia).  

There is a saline category in the ARC/INFO database (Table 10).  This was used in Canada and Alaska to map low-lying coastal wetlands.  In Russia, this code was initially used for large areas of the Yamal Peninsula, where there are saline sub-surface deposits.  After further consultation with N.G. Moskalenko, G.V. Ananjeva and D.S. Drozdov, the saline codes were changed to reflect the surface soil chemistry that directly controls plant growth, rather than the chemistry of underlying deposits.  The remaining saline areas on the Yamal Peninsula are mostly coastal and estuarine areas that are too small to show up at the scale at which the Substrate pH map was printed, and so were combined with the circumneutral areas.

Canada:  The substrate code was based largely on Charles Tarnocai's Soil Landscapes of Canada web site with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/nsdb/slc/).  This site includes maps of "Parent Material Calcareous Class".  In addition, surface geology maps which showed the occurrence of limestones and dolomites were used for areas which were too rocky to have soils data (see Appendix B for references).  These categories were compared with existing vegetation maps (and areas where known vegetation types conflicted with the mapped substrate were changed to match the substrate type indicated by the vegetation.

Greenland: The Greenland substrate types were based on the ILUM types, as mapped by F.J.A. Daniels and M. Wilhelm (see Greenland vegetation mapping).

Iceland: The Iceland polygons were all mapped as circumneutral by E. Einarsson.

Norway: The Norway substrate types were based on the description of the vegetation type assigned to each polygon by Arve Elvebakk (se Norway vegetation mapping).

Russia: The mapping of substrate chemistry in Russia was based mostly on the vegetation types, which were described as acidic or non-acidic (circumneutral).  There was also a substrate category which distinguished saline polygons (see Russia vegetation mapping). In addition, the lithology of the polygons, based on maps of surface geology (Ganeshin et al. 1976) and bedrock geology (Nalivkin et al. 1966), was used.  The bedrock geology map was used to distinguish regions with karst-able rocks, especially in areas without a thick cover of loose Quaternary sediment.  Karst areas were classified as circumneutral.  The substrate mapping was closely proofed by the Russian mappers during M. Raynolds' visit to Moscow in October 2002.

United States: Substrate chemistry from the United States was based on surface and bedrock geology maps of Alaska (Beikman 1980, Karlstrom 1964, Williams et al. 1977), and experience based on years of field work by D.A. Walker, C.J. Markon, and M.T. Jorgenson.

Vegetation, especially in the Arctic, is not homogeneous.  Thus, each CAVM polygon, which covers at least 50 km2, contains many vegetation types. The map portrays the dominant zonal vegetation.  This is the vegetation that develops under the prevailing climate, uninfluenced by extremes of soil moisture, snow, soil chemistry, or disturbance. Zonal sites are flat or gently sloping, moderately drained, with fine-grained soils. Areas of extensive azonal vegetation, those that are dependent on specific soil or hydrological conditions, such as mountain ranges, large wetlands, and river systems, were also mapped.

The 400 plant community types were grouped into five major physiognomic units, coded with alphabetic codes:

Major Physiognomic Unit Unit Code
Barrens B
Graminoid tundras G
Prostrate-shrub tundras P
Erect-shrub tundras S
Wetlands W

These were subdivided into 15 vegetation mapping units with numeric codes added to the alphabetic codes. The mapping units were named according to the dominant plant functional types (except in the mountains where complexes of vegetation were named according to the dominant bedrock (Carbonate and Noncarbonate mountain complexes). The plant functional types were based on a variety of criteria including growth form (e.g., graminoids, shrubs), size (e.g., dwarf and low shrubs), and taxonomical status (e.g., sedges, rushes, grasses).

The legend takes into special consideration the stature of woody shrubs, which is a major diagnostic feature of zonal vegetation in the Arctic. Zonal areas in Bioclimate Subzone A lack woody shrubs and are generally are either nearly totally barren (Map Unit B1) or consist of a thin cover of herbaceous plants, mosses and lichens (Map Unit G1). In Subzone B, prostrate dwarf shrubs are a major component of the zonal vegetation (Map Units G2 and P1). In Subzone C, hemiprostrate dwarf shrubs, particularly Cassiope tetragona, often form a major component of the vegetation, (Map Unit P2). Hemiprostrate dwarf shrubs are very short, generally less than 0.15 m tall, with a semi-erect or trailing stems. In Subzone D, erect dwarf shrubs, less than 0.4 m tall, are common (Map Units G3, G4, S1, and W2). And in Subzone E, low shrubs, 0.4 m to 2 m tall, are common (Map Units S2 and W3).

The colors of the map units are suggestive of the general outward appearance of vegetation (physiognomy). Grays correspond to barren types, browns to graminoid dominated types in the mineral-dominated soils of the High Arctic (Subzones A, B, and C), yellows to graminoid dominated types on peaty soils of the Low Arctic (subzones D and E). Pinks correspond to prostrate dwarf-shrub types of the High Arctic, and greens to the erect-shrub types of the Low Arctic. Blue greens correspond to the wetland types. The relationship of the mapping units to the summer temperature (bioclimate subzones) and soil moisture gradients is shown in the figure on the upper left of the CAVM vegetation map.


Mapping elevation zonation in the mountains
Vegetation in mountainous regions changes with elevation, forming distinctive elevational belts which correspond approximately to the bioclimatic subzones. For every 333-m elevation gain, the mean July temperature decreases by about 2˚C, as predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate of 6˚ C per 1000 m. Since only one elevational belt can be represented on each polygon, the color of the lowest belt was used for the polygon, though higher elevational belts may exist in that polygon.  

Mountainous areas of the map are shown with hachures. The background color indicates the nature of the bedrock (magenta for non-carbonate bedrock - mainly sandstone and granite, blue-purple for carbonate bedrock such as limestone and dolomite).  The color of the stripes of the hachures correspond to the colors of the bioclimate subzone in which the mountains occur (purple, Subzone A; blue, Subzone B; green, Subzone C; yellow, Subzone D; and red, Subzone E). The code numbers in mountainous areas have an additional small alphabetic suffix that indicates the subzone at the base of the mountains. Carbonate mountains (map code B4) in Subzone E have a small e added to the (map code B4e). Such mountains could have six elevation belts, Belts a-e (if the mountains were tall enough).   Mountains in Subzone A have only one elevation belt (Belt a), because any additional altitude results in permanent snow-cover.

The lowest belt, Belt e is dominated by low-shrub tundra (S2); the next higher belt, Belt d has erect dwarf-shrub tundra (S1); Belt c has prostrate dwarf-shrub, herb tundra (P1); Belt b has rush/grass, forb, cryptogam tundra (G1); Belt a has cryptogam, herb barrens (B1). Vegetation is modified by local slope, aspect, and cold-air drainage. 

Canada vegetation mapping
The Canadian mapping effort was initiated by Stephen Zoltai of Natural Resources Canada.  It was continued after his death by William Gould (University of Colorado, Boulder at that time), with assistance from Martha Raynolds (University of Alaska Fairbanks).  

Background ancillary data on landscape, substrate type (saline/acid/non-acid from bedrock, surface geology and soils), and percent lake cover were combined into Integrated Landscape Units (ILUM), which were mapped based on interpretation of the AVHRR false-CIR image.  References for the Canadian mapping are listed in Appendix B. 

A lookup table was then created which assigned each combination of ILUM and bioclimate subzone to one of the vegetation physiognomy units (Table 3).This cross-walk table was modified based on input from Sylvia Edlund and Lawrence Bliss, to reflect their knowledge of Canadian arctic vegetation types and distributions.
 
Greenland vegetation mapping
Greenland was mapped by Fred Daniëls, with assistance from Maike Wilhelm, both at the Institute of Plant Ecology in Münster, Germany.  

Greenland was mapped in ARC/VIEW.  The initial effort was to generalize the coastline and glacier boundaries in a way that was useful for the scale of the CAVM (see metadata for coastline and glaciers).  Nunatak polygons were delineated around complexes of ice and land, where the area was &lt; 75% ice.  

Since most of Greenland is mountainous, vegetation distribution is mainly controlled by bioclimate subzone and surface topography.  41 different Integrated Landscape Units (ILUM) were described, combining moisture, substrate pH, elevation and slope attributes.  All polygons were also given a vegetation code by the mappers, based on the ILUM code and existing maps and ground data on vegetation type distribution.  The shape file was converted into an ARC/INFO coverage, and the vegetation codes were used to assign CAVM vegetation physiognomy units according to the cross-walk table below (Table 4).More details describing the mapping of Greenland, and references can be found in "On the way to an integrated vegetation map of Greenland" by F.J.A. Daniels and M. Wilhelm in Raynolds and Markon (2002).

Iceland vegetation mapping
Iceland was mapped by Eythór Einarsson and Gudmundur Gudjónsson, at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.  The main issue in mapping Iceland was deciding on the boundary of the Arctic (see tree line metadata).  Only the northern rim of Iceland was considered Arctic and mapped by Eythor Einarsson as part of the CAVM.  All of the polygons were mapped as low shrub, except for one glacier.  For more discussion of the location of the Arctic boundary and references, see "The position of Iceland in the system used in the CAVM mapping" by E. Einarsson in Raynolds and Markon (2002).

Norway vegetation mapping
Norway was mapped by Arve Elvebakk with help from Bernt Johansen, both from the University of TromsØ in Norway.  For mainland Fennoscandia, the primary issue was the location of the Arctic boundary (see tree line metadata).  For Svalbard, Arve Elvebakk created detailed vegetation maps.  These were digitized to create an ARC/INFO coverage.  His vegetation types were mapped as CAVM vegetation physiognomy units according to the cross-walk table below (Table 5).  For more discussion of the vegetation mapping and references, see "A draft circumarctic vegetation map of the Norwegian Arctic" by A. Elvebakk in Raynolds and Markon (2002).

Russia vegetation mapping
Sergei Kholod of the Komarov Institute, St. Petersburg mapped the polygons of European Russia.  Natalia Moskalenko of the Earth Cryosphere Institute, Moscow mapped the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas.  Adrian Katenin of the Komarov Institute, St. Petersburg mapped Yakutia and Chukotka.  Boris Yurtsev, also of the Komarov Institute, edited the zonation boundaries, and the mapping of Wrangel Island and Chukotka.  Nadezhda Matveyeva and Elena Pospelova revised the mapping of the Taymyr Peninsula.  More information on the Russia mapping process, and references can be found in the chapters of Markon and Raynolds (2002) titled: "Vegetation map of European Russia" by S.S. Kholod and G.V. Ananjeva, "Vegetation map of west Siberia, Taimyr, Yakutia" by N.G. Moskalenko, "Landscape map of the Russian Arctic" by D.S. Drozdov and G.V. Ananjeva., and "Some questions of mapping circumpolar Arctic vegetation (CAVM)" by B.A. Yurtsev.

Natalia Moskalenko took the separate vegetation maps and combined their units into one legend with 110 types (see Appendix C), which were assigned as the vegetation id's for the polygons.  The vegetation polygons were combined with information from landscape, surface geology and bedrock geology maps by Dmitry Drozdov and Yuri Korostelev of the Earth Cryosphere Institute in Moscow.  The result was a vector file that could be imported into ARC/VIEW.  The file was converted from a shape file to a polygon coverage, and flipped to the CAVM projection (the Russians used a projection with 45oE at the bottom).  Additional lake polygons were added by M.K. Raynolds, as very few were in the original cover.  Lakes were digitized following outlines visible on the AVHRR false-CIR.  Each polygon had a long code which was made up of codes for zone, landscape, lithology and substrate.  This code was divided up into four separate items in the ARC/INFO coverage. An initial Integrated Landscape Unit (ILUM) was chosen based on the description of the vegetation type and the landform information (see Table 6).  This assignment of codes was reviewed by Natalia Moskalenko and Martha Raynolds in Fairbanks in August 2001. CAVM vegetation physiognomy units were assigned to the polygons based on bioclimate subzone and ILUM value, using a lookup table (Table 3 in Canada section, above). These codes were used to make maps which were reviewed in detail during a meeting between Martha Raynolds and the Russian mappers in Moscow during October 2002.


United States vegetation mapping
Donald (Skip) Walker mapped the North Slope of Alaska, Carl Markon mapped southwest Alaska, and Martha Raynolds mapped the Seward Peninsula.  The North Slope and the Seward Peninsula of Alaska were mapped following the methods described above (Walker 1999).  Background ancillary data on landscape, substrate type (saline/acid/non-acid from bedrock, surface geology and soils), and percent lake cover were integrated into Integrated Landscape Units (ILUM), which were mapped based on interpretation of the AVHRR false-CIR image.  CAVM vegetation physiognomy units were assigned to the polygons based on bioclimate subzone and ILUM value, using a lookup table (see table in Canada section, above).  D.A. Walker's mapping of the North Slope of Alaska is documented in Walker (1999).  M.K. Raynolds followed similar procedures for mapping the Seward Peninsula. References are listed in Appendix D.

Carl Markon mapped southwest Alaska, creating as a set of ARC/VIEW shape files, one for each type of background data. References are listed in Appendix E.  An effort was made to make congruent lines identical in the separate coverages, however most of the separate lines and polygons from the ancillary data were kept.  No separate polygon coverage was drawn based on interpretation of the AVHRR image.  Martha Raynolds combined all of the ARC/VIEW files into one ARC/INFO polygon coverage.  This process created many sliver polygons, which were edited by hand.  Arcs were deleted to combine polygons that were either too small or very similar to an adjacent polygon.  Arcs were also added and changed to match the AVHRR image (particularly lake boundaries).  Attributes for each polygon were brought in from the shape files.  Carl Markon mapped 18 vegetation and 9 landscape categories (Table 7).  These were used to assign ILUM categories to the polygons.  The final step followed the same method as the rest of Alaska and Canada:  CAVM vegetation physiognomy units were assigned to the polygons based on bioclimate subzone and ILUM value, using a lookup table (Table 3 in Canada section, above).

 Lake cover strongly affects the albedo, or reflectance, of the land surface over large areas of the Arctic, and is useful for delineating extensive wetlands.  Initially lake cover was derived from the AVHRR imagery in several different ways, producing maps that were used to help define vegetation polygons.  For Russia, the Map of the World hydrology cover was converted to lake polygons, and then a grid cell analysis (20 x 20 km cell size) was used to calculate percent lake cover.  For Canada, a similar procedure was used, with a 7.5 x 7.5 km cell size.  For Alaska, visual estimates from 1:63,360 topography maps were used to classify percent lakes.  For Greenland, visual estimates of percent lakes were made based on the AVHRR false-CIR imagery, as well as from topography maps.

The final percent lake cover map was calculated as the number of AVHRR Band 2 water pixels in each mapped CAVM polygon, divided by the total number of pixels in the polygon. Since the imagery has a pixel size of 1 km2, lake cover is underestimated for areas with many small lakes. No pixels were sampled within 2 pixels (2 km) of the coastline to avoid including ocean pixels.  The percent cover data were grouped into six categories: &lt; 2%, 2-10%, 10-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100% (Table 11).  Since the sum of the last three categories was only 1.5%, (the 75-100% category covered 1% of the map), they were combined for the map into one category,  &gt;25% for mapping purposes.
